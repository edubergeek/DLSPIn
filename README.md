## Level 1 tarball
Each tar file contains 875 FITS files.
Each FITS file is a point in time slit image on the solar disc in x arcsec pixels.
The Y (512) dimension is Y on the solar disc in 0.317 arcsec pixels.
The W (112) dimension is wavelength in 0.021549 Angstrom pixels centered (pixel 56.5) on 6302.08A.
The Z (4) dimension is the Stokes vector.

## Visualization image data
The X (875) dimension is X on the solar disc where x=56 (6302A) for each of 875 FITS files.
The Y (512) dimension is Y on the solar disc for all y in Y.
The Z (1) dimension is the Stokes I parameter (z=0).

## Training image data
The X (875) dimension is X on the solar disc where x=56 (6302A) for each of 875 FITS files.
The Y (512) dimension is Y on the solar disc in 0.317 arcsec pixels.
The Z (4) dimension is the Stokes vector.
